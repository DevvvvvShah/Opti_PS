### Running the Program  

#### 1. Command-Line Interface  

Run the following command in the repository folder:  

```
python main.py
```  

For advanced usage, an optional timeout parameter t (in seconds) can be added to control the runtime. Here t is not the total runtime, but the time the MIP solvers will run for:  

```
python main.py t
```  

#### 2. Streamlit Web Application  

To run the Streamlit app, use one of the following commands in the terminal inside the repository folder:  

```
streamlit run Streamlit_App.py
```  

If the above doesn't work, try:  

```
python3 -m streamlit run Streamlit_App.py
```  

Or:  

```
python -m streamlit run Streamlit_App.py
```
